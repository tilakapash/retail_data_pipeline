# retail_data_pipeline

## Datacamp Project consisting of Building a Retail Data Pipeline

### Project Description

Mastering data pipelines is essential for Data Engineers today. It involves extracting, transforming, and loading data — a fundamental task that ensures information flows smoothly.

In this project, you will work with retail data from a multinational retail corporation Walmart. You will retrieve data from different sources, like SQL and parquet; prepare the data using some transformation techniques, and finally load the data in an easy-to-access format.

### Project Instructions

Build a data pipeline using custom functions to extract, transform, aggregate, and load e-commerce data. The SQL query for grocery_sales and the extract() function have already been implemented for you.

To start the project, run the first two cells, then proceed with the following steps:

1. Implement a function named transform() with one argument, taking merged_df as input, filling missing numerical values (using any method of your choice), adding a column "Month", keeping the rows where the weekly sales are over $10,000 and drops the unnecessary columns. Ultimately, it should return a DataFrame and be stored as the clean_data variable.

2. Implement the function avg_weekly_sales_per_month with one argument (the cleaned data). This function will calculate the average monthly sales. For implementing this function you must select the "Month" and "Weekly_Sales" columns as they are the only ones needed for this analysis, then create a chain operation with groupby(), agg(), reset_index(), and round() functions, then group by the "Month" column and calculate the average monthly sales, then call reset_index() to start a new index order and finally round the results to two decimal places.

3. Create a function called load() that takes the cleaned and aggregated DataFrames, and their paths, and saves them as clean_data.csv and agg_data.csv respectively, without an index.

4. Lastly, define a validation() function that checks whether the two csv files from the load() exist in the current working directory.

### How to Approach the Project

#### 1. Extracting the data
Extract the data from PostgreSQL and parquet file.

#### 2. Transforming the data
Perform imputation, filtering, and cleaning.

#### 3. Preliminary analysis of the sales data
After cleaning the data, you will conduct a preliminary analysis.

#### 4. Loading and validating the data
Final step is to store your transformed data and validate that it was stored correctly.
